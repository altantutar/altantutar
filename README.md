# Hey, I'm Altan

Software engineer at **Snap**. I build tools that sit at the intersection of AI, automation, and developer infrastructure.

### Featured Projects

**[IronClaw](https://github.com/altantutar/ironclaw)** — A security-first personal AI assistant written in Rust. WASM-sandboxed tool execution, prompt injection defense, persistent memory with hybrid FTS + vector search, and multi-channel I/O (TUI, HTTP, Telegram). Built with defense-in-depth from the ground up.

**[Synapse Daemon](https://github.com/altantutar/synapse-daemon)** — Ambient intelligence for your desktop. Passively watches your screen via Screenpipe, detects repetitive workflows using Claude, and auto-generates automations. Ships as a native app with daemon, CLI, and agent integration.

**[Co-Founder Agent](https://github.com/altantutar/co-founder-agent)** — A personal thinking workspace that ingests the content you read — tweets, articles, notes — and turns it into structured, long-term memory you can reason over. Full RAG pipeline with pgvector, FastAPI, and Next.js.
